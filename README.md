# .dotfiles

My dotfiles

TODO: emacs and doom config
TODO: batman & less as fallback manpager
TODO: nushell? 
TODO: install atuin and setup, but sync should be studied, it should not store secrets entered?? 

NOTE: making emacs server run at startup is a better practice and maybe automate this?
NOTE: Since there is stowrc file it's sufficient to `stow .` but for dirs like zsh or bin, command should be `stow --target=~ bin`
