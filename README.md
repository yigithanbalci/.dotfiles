My dotfiles

TODO: stow double stows local to .config and .local for some reason

TODO: a proper settings for vscode including neovim bindings

TODO: emacs and doom config

TODO: fish error: paste from clipboard throws error
TODO: fish ctrl-c does not reload/repaint

NOTE: making emacs server run at startup is a better practice and maybe automate this?
NOTE: Since there is stowrc file it's sufficient to `stow .` but for dirs like zsh or bin, command should be `stow --target=~ bin`
